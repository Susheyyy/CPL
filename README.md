Programs covered in CPL curriculum


List of Experiments:
1. Write a program to swap two variables' values with and without using third variables. Write algorithm and draw flowchart for the same.

2. Write a program to check odd or even number: (a) using modulus operator (b) using conditional operator.

3. Design and develop a C program to read a year as an input and find whether it is leap year or not. Also consider the end of the centuries. Write algorithm and draw flowchart for the same.

4. Write a C program to find the whether the number is an AMSTRONG number or not

5. Design and develop a flowchart or an algorithm that takes three coefficients (a,b, and c) of a Quadratic Equation (ùëéùë•2 + ùëèùë• + ùëê = 0) as input and compute all possible roots. Implement a C program for the developed flowchart/algorithm and execute the same to output the possible roots for a given set of coefficients with appropriate messages.

6. Write a program to calculate 1/1!+2/2!+3/3!+‚Ä¶‚Ä¶+n/n!.

7. Write a menu driven program to perform simple arithmetic operations based on the user's choice. The user will indicate the operation to be performed using the signs e.g. + for addition, etc. Write an algorithm and draw flowchart for same.

8. Write a program to read a number of more than one digit, reverse the number and display the sum of digits of numbers. Write algorithm and draw flowchart for the same.

9. Write a program to print given number pattern using for loop.

10. Write a C program to find maximum and minimum between two numbers using functions. Write algorithm and draw flowchart for the same.

11. Write C program to find GCD of two integers by using recursive function.

12. Write a C program to find both the largest and smallest number in a list of integers. Write algorithm and draw flowchart for the same.

13. Develop, implement and execute a C program that reads two matrices A (m x n) and B (p x q) and compute product of matrices A and B. Read matrix A and matrix B in row major order and in column major order respectively. Print both the input matrices and resultant matrix with suitable headings and output should be in matrix format only.

14. Write a Program for deletion of an element from the specified location from Array.

15. Write a C program using user defined functions to determine whether the given string is palindrome or not.

16. Write C program to count the number of lines, words and characters in a given text.

17. Write a program to swap two numbers using a function. Pass the values to be swapped to this function using the call-by-value method and call-by-reference method.

18. Demonstrate structure and Union to specify data on students like Roll-number, Name, Department, Course, Year of Joining and Print the data of a student according to roll number.

19. Write a program to copy one array to another using pointer.

20. Write a program to read a file and display its contents along with line numbers before each line
